# Notes for "A Climatology of Arctic Rain On Snow and Winter Snow Events"

## I already have some basic plots made
See notebooks:

## My suggestions to Mark

1. Identify a subset of the stations for a representative period that will allow us to do a climatological analysis
   - Seasonal distributions of ROS or winter rain events for each station
   - Monthly time series of ROS or winter rain 
   - Annual time series ... 
   - Trend analysis
2. Identify what we mean by winter - temperature threshold versus snow on the ground.  Or just use a time-based criteria.  This depends on location, which is where temperature may come into place.
3. I wonder if we can identify some clusters; i.e stations that have always experienced ROS, versus stations that have started to have ROS.
4. We could leverage some of the SOM analysis that Taylor did
